      <h2>Band as a Whole:</h2>
<!-- Picture on the left -->
        <p>Balancing male-female harmonies, strutting guitars, wild horn arrangements, and interminable grooves, a spirit takes shape on stage nightly for Turkuaz via larger-than-life performances. Among numerous critical plaudits, The New Yorker claimed, “[Turkuaz] delivers horn-filled funk incorporating elements of R&B, psychedelic pop, gospel, Afro-pop, New Wave, classic rock, and just about any genre that gets people dancing.”</p>
      <h2>Juno Nominated</h2>
<!-- picture on the right -->
        <p>Before joining the group, Juno Nominated was an artist who performed on four of the seven continents. Wearing several hats as writer, composer, producer, creative director and promoter, Chelsea successfully hand selects other talented artists in Toronto to be her opening acts for her own annual live music series ‘An Intimate Evening with Chelsea Stewart’.
        <p>From Rototom Sunsplash in Europe, to Reggae Sumfest in Jamaica, to arenas in South Africa, Chelsea is continuously making moves and making people move with her style of reggae music worldwide. Just coming off of her first African tour, Chelsea has been melting hearts country to country with her sweet lollipop voice laced with enough sugar to help make the bitterness of life's struggles a bit sweeter.</p>
