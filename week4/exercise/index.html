<!-- center butt -->
      <p>The Caramoorr Music Festival announced the 2020 event's cancellation Monday. Organizers of the 3-day event cited conditions surrounding COVID-19 and current mandates from the state government as reasons for the cancellation. "The safety and health of our guests, artists, partners, and staff are always our first priority," Bill Donabedian, co-founder of the festival, said in a press release. The announcement comes after many other fairs and festivals across the state have made similar announcements. Others still are looking to keep their events alive in some way or another.</p>
